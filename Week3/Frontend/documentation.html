                The file format saves a 3d array in binary. <br />
                It first contains the following number: (len- 1) * 91 * 91 + x * 91 + y, similar to saving those 3 numbers in base-91 <br />
                len = the length of the creator's name <br />
                x = The index of the size of the first dimension of the array among all of the divisors of the total matrix size. <br />
                y = The index of the size of the second dimension of the array among all of the divisors of the total matrix size. <br />
                Then there are len times 7 bits for the creator's name. Then it is completed with 0's to a byte <br />
                Then there are 4 bytes for each number in the 3d array <br />
                Each number is saved this way: if it is among multiple bytes, the first byte contains the least significant bits and the last byte the most significant. <br />
                It is also this way when encoding the header - It treats it as a sequence of bits, from the least significant to the most significant, then divides it into bytes,
                The first byte contains the least significant bits and the last byte the most significant. <br />

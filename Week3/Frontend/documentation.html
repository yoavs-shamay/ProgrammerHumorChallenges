                The file format saves a 3d array in binary. <br />
                It first contains the following number: (len- 1) * 91 * 91 + x * 91 + y, similar to saving those 3 numbers in base-91. We will save it in 19 bits. <br />
                len = the length of the creator's name <br />
                x = The index of the size of the first dimension of the array among all of the divisors of the total array size. <br />
                y = The index of the size of the second dimension of the array among all of the divisors of the total array size. <br />
                Then there are len times 7 bits for the creator's name. Then it is completed with 0's to a byte <br />
                Then there are 4 bytes for the date. <br />
                Then there are 4 bytes for each number in the 3d array <br />
                Each number is saved this way: if it is among multiple bytes, the first byte contains the least significant bits and the last byte the most significant. <br />
                It is also this way when encoding the header - It treats it as a sequence of bits, from the least significant to the most significant, then divides it into bytes,
                The first byte contains the least significant bits and the last byte the most significant. <br />
                For example: <br />
                The date is 123, The creator name is "yodi555", And the array is 2x2x2 <br />
                The array is the following: [[[1,2],[3,4]],[[5,6],[7,8]]] <br />
                Then the total array size is 2 * 2 * 2 = 8, and its divisors are 1,2,4,8 <br />
                So x = 1, y = 1, and len = 7 <br />
                Then the first number in the header is 6 * 91 * 91 + 1 * 91 + 1 = 49778 <br />
                In binary it is 1100001001110010, after flipped and completed to 19 bits: 0100111001000011000 <br />
                The first letter in the creator name is 'y', which is 121 in ascii, in binary it is 1001111, after flipped and completed to 7 bits: 1111001 <br />
                If we continue this way and append to our initial number we will get 010011100100001100010011111111011001001110010111010110101011010101100000 <br />
                Note that if we divide it to bytes, It is written from the least significant bit to the most significant bit within the byte. <br />
                Now we append 4 bytes to the date. The date is 123, which is 1111011 in binary. <br />
                After flipped it is 1101111 and it is filled with 0 to 32 bits. <br />
                Now in a similar way we append the numbers in the array. <br />
                The result we should get is:<br />
                010011100100001100010011111111011001001110010111010110101011010101100000110111100000000000000000000000001000000000000000000000000000000001000000000000000000000000000000110000000000000000000000000000000010000000000000000000000000000010100000000000000000000000000000011000000000000000000000000000001110000000000000000000000000000000010000000000000000000000000000
